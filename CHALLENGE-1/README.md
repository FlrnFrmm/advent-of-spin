# Challenge 1

Welcome to challenge one of Fermyon’s Advent of Spin!

This first challenge will introduce you to:

- Spin CLI
- Deploying first application to Cloud
- Advent of Code test harness 
- Submission process

We want to keep this first challenge rather trivial, but push it a little beyond “Hello, world!”.

The elves have decided that Santa wants to migrate away from AWS (Arctic Web Services), but their legacy systems weren’t built to be API first.

Let’s change that by deploying our first JSON Hello World! API endpoint.
